    <h2 style="color:rgb(207, 87, 7)"> Displaying the map in different projections using QGIS</h2>
    <p> In this project I displayed the map in different projections by using information provided by ESRI in QGIS. I first added a vector layer into QGIS by uploading the countries shape file from natural earth. This vector layer displayed a map that I could manipulate in QGIS by using different projections. In order to view the different projections I could use, I clicked on the ESRI button in the bottom right corner. This action pulled up a list of different coordinate reference systems. In order to display a map in different projections, I then selected one coordinate reference system and clicked okay to apply it to the map. After I applied a coordinate reference system to the map, I created a label for it and converted it into a png file to display on my website. I repeated this process multiple times, but with a different coordinate reference system for each map. Ultimately, I created nine different maps that are each displayed with a different projection. </p>

    <h2 style="color:rgb(207, 87, 7)">WGS84 Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection seems to preserve direction and distance. All of the cirlces are oriented vertically in a north-to-south direction. In addition, distance is very well preservd in that all of the rectangles between the circles appear to be the same size. However, the projection seems to distort area and shape. The circles closer to the poles are not only larger than the circles near the equator, but they are also wider and appear more flat or squished down. </h3>

    <h2 style="color:rgb(207, 87, 7)">Aitoff Projection</h2>
    <h3> This projection of the map appears to have many distortions. The most apparent distortion is direction. The circles in the southern hemisphere are pointing outwards while the circles in the northern hemisphere are pointing inwards. In addition, there is a distortion of area and shape. The circles farthest away from both the prime meridian and the equator are larger and seem more squished vertically. Distance is also somewhat distorted in that the rectangles between the circles near the poles are a different size than the rectangles between the circles near the equator. </h3>

    <h2 style="color:rgb(207, 87, 7)">Pseudo-Mercator Projection</h2>
    <h3>In general, this projection appears to preserve many features of the map. The projection clearly preserves shape in that all of the circles appear to be well rounded circles with little to no squishing or flattening effects. In addition, this projection preserves direction. All of the circles are directed vertically in a north-to-south direction. Distance is also well preserved near the equator; the rectangles between the circles, and thus distance, are only moderately affected near the poles. Unfortunately, this projection distorts area. The circles closest to the north and south poles are much larger than the circles near the equator.  </h3>

    <h2 style="color:rgb(207, 87, 7)">Sphere Winkel I Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection seems to display minimal distortion across all of the features of the map. The projection slightly distorts area in that the circles near the north and south poles are somewhat larger in size compared to the circles near the equator. In addition, this projection moderately distorts shape. The circles near the equator are slightly flattened vertically while the circles near the poles have a more circular, rounded shape. The projection also distorts direction. The circles in the southern hemisphere slightly point outwards while the circles in the northern hemisphere slightly point inwards. Overall, this projection preserves distance in that the area is generally the same size between all of the circles. The distance is slightly distorted near the poles, but it is not extreme. </h3>

    <h2 style="color:rgb(207, 87, 7)">World Cylindrical Equal Area Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection seems to preserve area and also direction quite well. As indicated by the name, this projection preserves area. Although the varying shapes makes it hard to tell on the map, this projection appears to preserve the area of the circles quite well. The map also preserves direction moderately well in that all of the circles are directed vertically in a north-to-south direction. Unfortunately, this projection evidently distorts shape. The circles closest to the north and south poles are quite severely squished and flattened horizontally. In addition, distance becomes quite distorted near the poles. </h3>

    <h2 style="color:rgb(207, 87, 7)">World Equidistant Conic Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection appears to preserve direction very well. All of the circles are oriented vertically in a north-to-south direction along the map. Unfortunately, this projection moderately distorts both area and shapes. The circles near the north pole are small and have a circular, rounded shape. However, as you move down towards the south pole, the circles increase in size and have a flatter, more horizontally squished shape. </h3>

    <h2 style="color:rgb(207, 87, 7)">North Pole Azimuthal Equidistant Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection has moderate-to-severe distortions. The most apparent distortions are distortions of both size and shape. Similar to the World Equidistanct Conic Projection, circles near the north pole are more small and round in shape while the circles near the south pole are more large and flattened horizontally in shape. Meanwhile, distance is preserved for the most part. As indicated by the name of the projection, distance between the circles appear to be well preserved. In addition, direction is preserved in that all off the circles are oriented vertically in a north-to-south direction.</h3>

    <h2 style="color:rgb(207, 87, 7)">World Robinson Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection has minimal distortions across all of the features. Shape is moderately distorted in that the circles in the north and south poles are somewhat wider than the circles near the equator. In addition, size is distorted. The circles farthest away from the equator are slightly larger than the circles near the equator. Direction is mostly preserved but the circles in the southern hemisphere slightly point outward while the circles in the northern hemisphere slightly point inward. For the most part, distance is preserved in which the area betwen all of the circles appear to be the same size. </h3>

    <h2 style="color:rgb(207, 87, 7)">World Loximuthal Projection</h2>
    <h3>Similar to the World Robinson projection, this projection has moderate distortions across all of the features. Size and shape are both moderately distorted in that circles close to the poles are both larger in size and wider compared to circles close to the equator. Meanwhile, direction is slightly distorted. The circles near the equator and prime meridian are oriented vertically in a north-to-south direction. However, circles that are farther away from both the equator and the prime meridian are pointed either inwards or outwards. For the most part, distance also seems to be preserved in that all of the rectangles between the circles appear to be the same size. </h3>
