    <h1>Homework 9: Make a choropleth or proportional symbol map</h1>
    <h2>Gabriela Alba</h2>
    <h3>The map I made depicts the food insecurity rate in Tennessee by county in the year 2018. I found my data from Map the Meal Gap, an initiative managed by Feeding America that seeks to provide data and encourage conversations about food insecurity in the United States. I selected food insecurity rates as my topic because I was interested in studying the prevalence of food insecurity in certain geographic areas. I have taken numerous food studies courses, and I think it is important to analyze how social, political, and economic factors can make it difficult for certain communities to access affordable and nutritious food. Everyone should have the right to access health food as it is critical to your physical and mental health. For this reason, it is important to identify the trends of food insecurity rates in geographic regions so that we can then identify specific obstacles and barriers that exist in local areas that contribute to food insecurity.   </h3>


    <h2 style="color:rgb(201, 107, 19)">Choropleth Map</h2>
    <h3> This choropleth depicts food insecurity rates in the state of Tennessee. The counties shaded in the deeper orange colors indicate that a higher percentage of people out of the total population are experiencing food insecurity in that county. The map shows that more rural and low-income counties have higher rates of food insecurity. Meanwhile, the counties close two of the largest cities in Tennessee, Nashville and Knoxville, have low rates of food insecurity. In the future, it would be insightful to create different maps of Tennessee to determine whether food insecurity rates are impacted by city size, a county's per capita income, or some other social, geographic, political or economic factor. </h3>
