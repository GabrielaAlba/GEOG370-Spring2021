    <h1>Homework 8: Census data ratios and categories</h1>
    <h2>Gabriela Alba</h2>
    <h3>This map depicts the percentage of people living in poverty below the age of 18 in Puerto Rico by county in the year 2019. The percentage I used is a ratio of the number of people below the age of 18 experiencing poverty to the total number of people experiencing poverty. I thought it would be useful and insightful to look at the percentage of children experiencing poverty because poverty can contribue to food insecurity, affect a child's physical and mental health, widen the acheivement gap, and much more. </h3>


    <h2 style="color:rgb(25, 87, 45)">Equal Interval Classification Scheme</h2>
    <h3> The equal interval classification scheme ensures that all of the classes are the same size. The main pro of this scheme is that the legend is easy for viewers to interpret and understand. The main con of this classification scheme is that most of the data may fall in only or or two of the classes. Fortunately, my data is equally dispersed throughout the range of attribute values. This means that the data values fell into somewhat evenly throughout the classes. However, if the data is not distributed evenly throughout the attribute range, this scheme would be problematic in that most of the data values would fall in only a few classes. </h3>

    <h2 style="color:rgb(25, 87, 45)">Quantile Classification Scheme</h2>
    <h3> The quantile classification scheme ensures that the same number of cases or data values fall into each class. The main pro of this scheme is that you can analyze the data values relative to one another. Since all of the classes contain the same number of data values, it makes it easy to understand which municipios, or counties, have the largest percentage of children experiencing poverty. However, this scheme could be very problematic if the data values aren't evenly distributed throughout the attribute range. If the data values vary a lot, this could create scenarios in which certain classes contains data values that are significantly different or certain data values that are similar are placed in different classes. These issues could in turn affect an accurate interpretation of the data.  </h3>

    <h2 style="color:rgb(25, 87, 45)">Natural Breaks Classification Scheme</h2>
    <h3> The natural breaks classification scheme uses an algorith to break up the data values into different classes. The main pro of this classification scheme is that it can deal with data that is unevenly distributed throughout the range of data values. The algorithm takes into account the distribution of the data when it determines the break points. However, this can also be problematic in that the classes may have significantly different ranges. Some classes may have a small range while others have large ranges. This means that the map can be easily misinterpreted, especially if the viewer does not take the time to look at and interpret the legend. </h3>
