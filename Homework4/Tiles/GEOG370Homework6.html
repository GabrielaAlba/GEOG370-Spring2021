In the historical image there are at least a dozen or so rows of cars parked in a parking lot beside a U shaped building. Now, the parking lot has been replaced as a green space. The U shaped building to the left of the parking lot is still standing. However, there is a new building in the right section of the old parking lot. This building is Louis Stoke's Health Sciences Library at Howard University. While there used to be a concrete parking lot, the area in between the U shaped building and the library is now a green space with crossing circular and perpendicular pathways.   <br/><img src='https://150.howard.edu/sites/150.howard.edu/files/small%20Louis%20Stokes.jpg'width='100px'/>";
